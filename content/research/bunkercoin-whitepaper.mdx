## Abstract

BunkerCoin is a novel Layer 1 blockchain protocol designed to operate under extreme bandwidth constraints - specifically over shortwave radio channels. While conventional blockchains assume high-speed internet connectivity, BunkerCoin addresses scenarios where internet infrastructure fails but economic activity and secure communication must continue.

## Core Innovation

**Alpenglow Consensus**: A dual-path voting mechanism adapted from Solana's research, achieving deterministic finality even under high-latency, intermittent connectivity conditions.

**Sherpa Routing**: Location-aware routing service that maintains network topology maps and optimizes data propagation paths across geographically dispersed radio links. Critical for efficient aggregation of BLS multi-signatures across high-latency networks.

**Radiotor Block Propagation**: Multi-path, location-aware block dissemination using erasure coding and parallel HF frequency channels to maximize throughput despite 300-byte MTU constraints.

## Technical Highlights

**Physical Layer:**
- Operates over PACTOR-IV or VARA HF radio protocols
- 300-byte Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)
- 32:96 erasure coding for reliability in high packet-loss environments
- Both reliable (ARQ) and broadcast (FEC) transmission modes
- LoRa "last mile" access for transaction submission without internet

**Consensus:**
- Stake-weighted validator selection
- Fast-finalization path: ≥80% stake approval in one round
- Standard finalization: ≥60% stake in two rounds
- Epoch-based state snapshots for bandwidth-efficient bootstrapping
- Proof of Location via cryptographic attestations (prevents Sybil attacks)

**State Model:**
- Simplified account model (no smart contracts by design)
- Compact token system with off-chain metadata
- Merkle-tree state snapshots for new node synchronization without full history

**Verified Offline Messaging:**
- Store-and-forward protocol with BLS signature aggregation
- Zero-knowledge proofs for fee calculation without revealing content
- Native integration with consensus layer

**Bridge Architecture:**
- Two-tier security: full validator set signs epoch certificates (VSCerts), internet-connected subset signs transfer certificates (BCerts)
- Requires ≥2/3 total stake for operation (not just online validators)
- Security equivalent to L1 consensus (superior to federated bridge models)
- Optional Merkle root anchoring to external chains for enhanced finality

## Why This Matters

**Real-world scenarios:**
- Disaster recovery when internet infrastructure fails
- Sanctioned or contested regions with unreliable connectivity
- Rural/remote areas with no broadband access
- Adversarial environments requiring censorship resistance

**Novel contributions:**
- First blockchain protocol specifically designed for HF radio constraints
- Location-aware routing as native consensus component
- Proof of Location using radio physics (signal delay, propagation patterns)
- Native offline messaging with cryptographic delivery proofs

## Research Challenges Solved

1. **Consensus under extreme latency**: Adapted fast-finality mechanisms to work with seconds-to-minutes propagation delays
2. **Efficient signature aggregation**: BLS multi-sig routing via Sherpa minimizes radio transmissions
3. **Bootstrap problem**: New nodes can sync from Merkle-proofed state snapshots instead of full history
4. **Bridge security**: Native consensus bridge avoids "smaller committee" vulnerability of federated models
5. **Sybil resistance**: Radio physics makes location spoofing cryptographically and physically difficult

## Current Status

**Active research and development.** Testnet deployment planned with nodes running both PACTOR-IV and VARA HF protocols to benchmark real-world performance under varying ionospheric conditions.

**Support**: Anatoly Yakovenko (Solana co-founder) contributed core concepts and publicly endorsed the project.

## Technical Depth

This protocol required spanning multiple domains:
- **Distributed systems**: Consensus mechanisms, fault tolerance, network partitions
- **Cryptography**: BLS signatures, zero-knowledge proofs, Merkle trees
- **Radio engineering**: HF propagation, ionospheric physics, spectrum management
- **Hardware integration**: PACTOR-IV modems, VARA software modems, LoRa gateways

Maintained, upgraded and expanded a legacy desktop chat automation solution for an undisclosed exclusive content site, using .NET / C#.

## Phantom

Built out phantom.ac, a state-of-the-art chat & outreach platform (think Infloww, but applicable to all exclusive content platforms).

- 2M+ messages handled across 12+ platforms
- Licensed to one of Germany's biggest exclusive content agencies for a % of revenue
- While competitors got banned for similar operations with inferior tooling, phantom kept the agency's operations in stealth

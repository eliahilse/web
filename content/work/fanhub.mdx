Founded and solo developed an automated social media growth service (SMM-Panel) processing hundreds of thousands of orders.

## Technical

- Built a fully automated order fulfillment system integrated with the industry's top bot pools
- Developed and refined frontend & backend systems, handling real-time orders at scale
- Scaled the platform to at peak handle 100,000+ daily orders

## Business

- Leveraged eBay-Kleinanzeigen (german fb marketplace) for initial traction, eventually forcing policy changes due to overwhelming demand
- Successfully onboarded top-tier SMM panels (e.g., smm-heaven.net, bulkfollows.com) to resell FanHub services
- Built out own bot offerings (Facebook Followers & YouTube Live Viewers)
- Exited after handing over the operational knowledge to top resellers

## Legal

Due to not being fully compliant with GDPR it also got me a €2,500 fine at age 14 - luckily I could convince the suing party to lower the demand to €250.

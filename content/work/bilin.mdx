## Other Work

Built the MVP on an exclusive content platform (working title _CryptoGirls_), including custom DRM, tradeable creator rights and posts, multi-level referral structures and feature-parity with the likes of OnlyFans (with far better performance). Also struck a dedicated High-Risk Master Processing Agreement with Visa and MasterCard.

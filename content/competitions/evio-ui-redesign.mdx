ev.io was a browser-based multiplayer FPS game with around 100k monthly active users, heavily integrated into the web3/NFT ecosystem at the time.

They ran a community UI redesign competition - I submitted a complete overhaul of their interface and took first place.

## Outcome

- Won $10k in NFTs
- My design changes were implemented 1:1 into the live game
- Got offered a role as Frontend Engineer afterwards, but ultimately didn't get in due to a company-wide hiring stop

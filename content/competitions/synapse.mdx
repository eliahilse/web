Synapse turns hidden company expertise into action.

Most organizations sit on a mountain of knowledge that’s hard to find when it matters. People leave, teams ship fast, docs go stale, and the same problems get solved again and again. Synapse makes that knowledge living, discoverable, and useful in the flow of work.

## What Synapse does

- **Immediate**: When someone hits a roadblock, Synapse connects them to the person who solved the problem before. Answers aren’t just documents — they’re people with context.
- **Effortless**: No new tools to learn. Talk to Synnie — our AI agent — via chat, a quick video, or a short phone call.
- **Living**: Synnie keeps knowledge current by checking in with people regularly and capturing what they worked on and what they learned.

## What it feels like for teams

Joe gets assigned a task he’s never seen before. Instead of digging through old files, he describes the problem to Synnie. Within seconds, Synapse finds Nick from Product — the person who solved this exact issue last quarter. Joe books a meeting, and a month of work turns into a morning.

## How it works

Synnie keeps organizational knowledge alive through lightweight, recurring conversations. Every week, she asks short, focused questions: what did you build, what broke, what did you learn, who did you work with? That context becomes searchable expertise across people, projects, and outcomes — not just static docs.

## Synapse Nexus

Synapse doesn’t just help one person at a time. The relationships Synnie uncovers form a living map of the company — **Synapse Nexus**. Leaders can see how knowledge flows, where the real experts are, and where collaboration is stuck. It’s visibility you can act on.

## A note on the hackathon

This track was judged on video submissions only — no code review. That favored production value over technical depth. We still placed second after a more than one‑hour debate among judges on whether we or a highly produced video should take first. We’re proud of that outcome — and even more proud of how far the product has come since.

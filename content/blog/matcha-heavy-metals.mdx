Long before the hype I was a big advocate for green tea, drinking it since childhood instead of coffee in the morning. Calmer boost, less jitter, solid neuro-preserving effects.

About two years ago I discovered matcha - green tea where you consume the entire leaf. More L-theanine, more EGCG, more of everything good. Still part of my daily stack.

There's one critical issue many are not aware though:

## The Heavy Metal Issue

The tea plant (*Camellia sinensis*) is a hyperaccumulator. It aggressively absorbs heavy metals from the soil - lead, cadmium, arsenic, aluminium - everything you _don't_ want to consume.

With regular green tea the issue isn't as bad since the leaves only release a fraction of that into the water (but similarly one also only gets a fraction of the good stuff).

With matcha, you're consuming the entire leaf. Every heavy metal the plant absorbed goes directly into your body.

## Origin Doesn't Matter (as much)

Most cheap matcha comes from China. Some from Japan. Many think Japanese = safe - wrong.

Based on what I observed, there's massive variance even among Matcha of Japanese origin. Few have good profiles, many have bad, and some are outright horrible - e.g. 12x the recommended daily aluminium intake per serving. High aluminium intake is directly linked to cognitive decline. This is nothing to joke about - not even to begin talking about lead & co.

## First Harvest Only

The longer tea plants sit in the soil, the more heavy metals they accumulate. First harvest (_ichiban-cha_) matcha has had the least time to collect contaminants. Later harvests concentrate more of the bad stuff.

If it doesn't say first harvest, skip it.

## Mixtures Aren't Bad

Unless you find a specific plantation that has perfect lab tests, it's often better to buy a mix from different plantations to get a more evened out profile in terms of heavy metals (stacking up disproportional amounts of one heavy metal is considered worse than loading up even).

## Only Buy Lab Tested Matcha

Only drink matcha that publishes third-party lab results covering all major heavy metals (and pesticides as a plus).

No public test = worst-case. Any even somewhat serious brand is publishing numbers, there's no ev in not publishing them if not bad.

Might sound paranoid, but the risk to accidentally loading up a bunch of heavy metals while trying to stay "healthy" is not neglible.

## What Good Looks Like

Here's what a solid lab test looks like (my current daily matcha - still looking for sub-300mg aluminium):

Key numbers: Aluminum at 532 mg/kg (low for matcha), lead at 0.075 mg/kg (negligible), no detectable pesticides.

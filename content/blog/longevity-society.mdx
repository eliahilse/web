# The Coming Age of Prolonged Life: A Society Unprepared

**Capitalism promised heaven on earth through hard work. What if it delivered — literally?**

## The Promise

Longevity treatments arrive. Initial cost: $10M/year. "No different than any new technology," they say. "It'll get cheaper." 

"This will save society! Wisdom won't be lost to death!"

The wealthy go first. Of course they do.

## The Ladder (20 Years In)

Costs drop to $500K/year. But then... they stop dropping.

A new class emerges: **Ascendants** — mortals granted treatment for exceptional contribution. Society celebrates: "See? It's accessible if you work hard enough!"

What nobody says out loud: 0.1% ascension rate. The rest age and die.

The immortals realize something crucial: **eternal life for everyone means stagnation**. No fresh ideas. No ladder to climb. No innovation.

So they don't make it universal. They make it *meritocratic*.

## The Perversion

This becomes normal.

- **Immortals** at the top: compound wealth, connections, influence for centuries
- **Ascendants** in the middle: conditional immortality — keep performing or lose access
- **Mortals** at the bottom: competing for scraps of extra years

Governments pivot from "serve the people" to "optimize mortal productivity." Dissent is reframed as "low performance." Critics age out. Protestors grow old and die. The immortals remain.

**The capitalist heaven is realized:** You can literally buy eternal life. You just have to earn it first.

## The Tyranny of the Patient

Democracy assumes mortality equalizes power eventually. Rulers want legacy *now* because they'll die soon.

Remove mortality, and you remove the need to compromise.

An immortal oligarch can outwait:
- Public outrage (people forget/die)
- Protests (movements fade)  
- Regulation (administrations change)
- Competition (rivals age out)

Four election cycles? They're still there.  
A generation of activists? They're still there.

The only check on their power is violence — and that's a line most won't cross.

## The Question We Should Ask Now

**Is this a dystopia? Or is this just capitalism working as intended?**

If you believe in meritocracy, how do you argue against immortality-as-reward?

If you don't believe in it... when did you stop?

## The Window Is Closing

We have maybe 10-20 years between "treatment exists" and "immortals consolidate irreversible power."

Either we make this accessible by Year 10 — publicly funded, patent-free, distributed by lottery not wealth — or by Year 30, the decision is no longer ours to make.

By then, the people deciding will be the ones who've already benefited from two extra decades of compounding advantages.

And they'll have all the time in the world to outwait our objections.

**We built a system where your value is measured in dollars. We shouldn't be surprised when the ultimate prize — time itself — is allocated the same way.**

**The question isn't whether we'll climb the ladder to immortality. It's whether we'll notice when the ladder becomes a treadmill.**
